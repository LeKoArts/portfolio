# LekoArts Portfolio (2017)

Static portfolio made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and with the help of SASS, Webstorm and Webpack.

## Develop

`gatby delevop` starts a hot-reloading development server at `localhost:8000`.

The .js files in "src/pages" represent the different pages. Links to these sites have to have the same name as the file (e.g. `<a href="/contact" />`refers to contact.js).

## Build

`gatsby build` creates the production build for the deployment.

## Plugins

Plugins are available [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/).
